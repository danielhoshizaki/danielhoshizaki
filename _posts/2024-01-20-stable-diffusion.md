How useful are generative techniques like stable diffusion for remote sensing applications? I would argue that current versions with limited conditioning are not particularly useful. If you have enough data to train a generator, you might as well use that data directly for a target application. Unless the generator is configured for fine grained control, I don't see any practical use cases for open, prompt based remote sensing image generation.
